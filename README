# Automata Learning from Preference and Equivalence Queries

The project website can be found at [https://eric-hsiung.github.io/remap](https://eric-hsiung.github.io/remap).

This is the experimental code repository for the paper

**Automata Learning from Preference and Equivalence Queries**

It contains an implementation of the REMAP algorithm, unit tests, and code for running experiments.
It additionally contains a fork where certain bugs in the [reward_machines](reward_machines/README)(Icarte et al. 2018) repository have been corrected.
The corrections are specification of a deterministic reward machine, specifically for CraftWorld.

The main README for REMAP is found at [remap/README](remap/README).
